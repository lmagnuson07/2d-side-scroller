# 2d JavaScript side-scroller game.
### [Live site](https://2d-side-scroller.netlify.app/) - hosted on netlify.
This will be my first attempt at coding a 2d game using vanilla JavaScript. I will be using the skills and techniques I learned from [Franks laboratories](https://www.youtube.com/c/Frankslaboratory) amazing [2d Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c&t=28598s) course. All of the art assets were purchased from [Bevouliin](https://bevouliin.com/), a very talented 2d artist. The purpose of this project is to practice some JavaScript techniques and improve my JavaScript skills with a fun and creative project that I can share with family, friends, colleagues, and peers. *I do not intend to make any money from this project. It is simply a creative endeavour*.
